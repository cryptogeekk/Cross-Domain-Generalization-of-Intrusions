# Cross-Domain Generalisation of Intrusions

System heterogeneity is widely seen in IoT devices these days. If an IoT device is deployed as a sensor node and is collecting outside information, the dataset generated by it varies in terms of a number of features. When we want one global model to be trained through the collaborative machine learning process like federated learning, we want the same number of features across all the peer nodes. We have solved the problem by reducing the number of features to the common features with the help of an autoencoder such that all the datasets can take part in federated training. The trained global model is able to generalize the labels present across all the datasets.

We trained our global model across six different datasets that varies in their number of features.
1. CICIDS 2018
2. CICIDS 2017
3. BOT IoT
4. NSL_KDD
5. TON_IoT
6. UNSW_NB15

# Result
Our result suggest that the global model was able to generalize across the intrusion classes present across all the datasets.
